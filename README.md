Premier League Performance Project

This Project was created to demonstrate a deep analysis of the English Premier League Soccer players' performances. 
This Python notebook utilizes Pandas and its other libraries to show step-by-step how a person can take a dataset and manipulate it into analyzable graphs.
Specifically, this project goes into great detail on the 2018/2019 season and classifies each position with "elite" players to help narrow down which players have the most impact.
My goal with this project was to display my passion for soccer and to develop a model that can be applied to any dataset for any season for the Premier League.
This dataset was retrieved from footystats.org, and it was a free dataset that did not require any payment, which is why I used this specific dataset.
My future plans with this model is to further optimize it to be applied to not only just other Premier League seasons, but for other sports as well. 
I believe that this model could be utilized in a predictive manner in deciding who might be the highest performing players that deserve accolades or to further support opinions of who deserve praise.
Back when I was developing this project sports betting was not something people believed accessible outside of casinos and Las Vegas, but now I believe this type of data science has potential for high impact.
